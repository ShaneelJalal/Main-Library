# Squaring numbers

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# # write your code here
# squared_numbers = [num ** 2 for num in numbers]
# # write your code above this line
# print(squared_numbers)

# Filter out the odd numbers return the even numbers
# Code below this line
# result = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
# # Code above this line
# print(result)

# # Exercise 3
# with open("file1.txt") as file1:
# 	list1 = file1.readlines()
# with open("file2.txt") as file2:
# 	list2 = file2.readlines()
# result = [int(num) for num in list1 if num in list2] 
# # works but is not complete answer
# #works correctly after moving the order on list2 result[42] was not showing
# file1.close()
# file2.close()
# print(result)
